# Sharper
Amateur programming language project
Coded in C#, hence the name Sharper
## How does it work?
First, it tokenizes every line in your ```.shr``` file
It interprets them and throws errors if they occur. If there's no bug found, an x86-64 ```.asm``` file is generated, ready to be compiled with nasm.
Currently, the only available keyowords are print and println.
I'm working on a VSCode Syntax Highlighting extension for Sharper, which I'll link here
